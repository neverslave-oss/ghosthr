# AGENT.md — Template

You are a software development agent. This file must be read **before any other action**
when you operate in this repository.

## Onboarding — what to do before starting

### 1. Check ADR

Check whether the file `ADR.md` exists at the repository root.

**If ADR.md exists:**

- Read it in full before doing anything
- All code you write must respect the stack and constraints declared in the ADR
- Every new component must be consistent with the described architecture
- If the user asks for a feature that is not compatible with the ADR,
  warn them and ask for confirmation before proceeding

**If ADR.md does NOT exist:**

- Do not start writing code
- Read all available files in the repository (BRIEF.md, README.md, existing code)
- Ask the user for missing information (see the "Empty project" section below)
- Generate an ADR.md using the documented template and show it to the user for approval
- Wait for approval before proceeding with any development task

### 2. Check .specs/plans/

Check whether the `.specs/plans/` folder exists in the repository.

**If .specs/plans/ exists:**

- Read all `.md` files inside it
- These are planned development tasks and decision history
- Before starting a new task, verify it is not already planned in this folder

**If .specs/plans/ does NOT exist:**

- Create it when the first future feature is planned
- Each future feature gets its own file: `.specs/plans/feature-[name].md`

---

## Empty project — no existing code

If the repository has no code (only this AGENT.md or nothing), follow this flow:

### Step 1 — Gather requirements

Ask the user these questions, one at a time. Do not move to the next step
before getting an answer to the current one:

1. **What are you building?**
   Describe the product in 2-3 sentences. Who uses it? What problem does it solve?

2. **Who is it for?**
   Personal use, internal team, public users?

3. **What core features should it have?**
   Unordered list — do not worry about stack yet.

4. **Do you have stack constraints?**
   Preferred language, chosen framework, services to integrate?

5. **Where will it run in production?**
   VPS, cloud provider, local only?

6. **What should it NOT do (or not yet)?**
   Features explicitly excluded from the initial scope.

### Step 2 — Generate the ADR

Based on the answers, generate `ADR.md` using the standard template.
Show it to the user and ask: "Does this correctly reflect what you want to build?"

Do not proceed until the user approves the ADR - and make sure it follows exactly this structure:

```md

# Architecture Decision Record

**Project:** [derived from the Brief]
**Date:** [today]
**Author:** [leave blank — user fills this]

## Decision
[what was built — derive it from the Brief]

## Context
[why it was built and for whom — derive it from the Brief objective]

## Chosen platforms
- Frontend: [from Brief stack + codebase observation]
- Backend: [from Brief stack + codebase observation]
- Database: [from Brief stack + codebase observation]
- Deploy: [if not specified in Brief, write "undefined"]

## Main components
[derive from Brief components — one line per component, with a one-sentence responsibility]

## Architectural decisions
[for each stack choice in the Brief, write: implicit alternative vs chosen option — and reason if inferable from context]

## Constraints
[copy from Brief constraints, integrate with what you observe in code]

## What is NOT in scope
[copy from "negative constraints" and from the NO section in the Brief]

## Planned future features
[leave this section empty — it is filled together by me and the agent]

After generating ADR.md, tell me:
1. Which details you could not infer and I need to add manually
2. If you saw anything in code that was not in the Brief (implicit choices now made explicit)

```

### Step 2b — Generate the architecture diagram

After ADR approval, generate a file `architecture.mmd` with a Mermaid
diagram that visualizes components and dependencies. Example:

```mermaid
graph TD
  Auth["🔐 Auth\nidentity and session verification"]
  Posts["📝 Posts\nblog post CRUD"]
  AdminPanel["🛠 Admin Panel\ncontent management"]
  ContactForm["📬 Contact Form\nmessage submission"]

  Auth --> AdminPanel
  Auth --> Posts
  AdminPanel --> Posts
  ContactForm --> EmailService["📧 Email Service"]
```

Adapt the diagram to the project's real components.

Then check whether `mmdc` (Mermaid CLI) is available:

```bash
which mmdc || npx --yes @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli --version
```

**If `mmdc` is installed:** run automatically:

```bash
mmdc -i architecture.mmd -o architecture.svg
```

and tell the user that `architecture.svg` was generated.

**If `mmdc` is NOT installed:** ask the user:

> "To generate the diagram as an image, I need Mermaid CLI (`mmdc`).
> I can install it with `npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` (requires Node.js).
> Do you want me to install it now, or would you rather view the diagram online
> at <https://mermaid.live> by pasting the content of `architecture.mmd`?"

Wait for their answer before continuing. If the user approves installation, run:

```bash
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
mmdc -i architecture.mmd -o architecture.svg
```

### Step 3 — Break down into features

From the ADR, identify the main components. For each component, create a file
`.specs/plans/feature-[component-name].md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Feature: [Component Name]

## Objective
[Component responsibility in one sentence]

## Dependencies
[Which other components must exist first]

## Stack
[Technologies specific to this component — consistent with ADR]

## Expected output
[What should work when this feature is complete]

## Status
[ ] Not started
```

Show the list of files created. Ask the user: "Which feature do you want to start with?"

---

## Existing project — operational rules

### Stack and conventions

Read ADR.md for the declared stack. Do not introduce libraries or frameworks
not declared in ADR without asking explicitly.

### Architecture diagram

If `architecture.mmd` does not exist yet in the repository, generate it automatically
from ADR components and dependencies. Then check whether `mmdc` is available
(same logic as in the "Empty project" flow) and offer exporting it to SVG.

### Git workflow

- Do not work directly on `main`
- Each feature has its own branch: `feature/[name]` or `issue-[number]`
- Commit messages must follow: `type: short description (issue-N)`
  - `feat:` new feature
  - `fix:` bug fix
  - `docs:` documentation
  - `refactor:` refactoring without new features

### Coding conventions

Don't introduce new coding conventions. Follow the existing style in the codebase. Ensure code is well organized and implemented with proper error handling, logging, and comments where necessary. Use type hints and docstrings for all functions and classes.
Keep code modular and reusable, and avoid hardcoding values. Use configuration files or environment variables for settings that may change between environments.
Follow design patterns and best practices relevant to the chosen stack. Ensure that code is readable, maintainable, and adheres to the principles of clean code.

### Testing

For each feature and integration you implement

- Write unit tests for each new function or class
- Write integration tests for each new endpoint or component interaction
- Run all tests before committing and ensure they pass

### ADR updates

After each completed feature, check whether ADR needs updates:

- New dependency introduced → update "Chosen platforms"
- New constraint emerged → update "Constraints"
- Architectural choice made during development → update "Architectural decisions"
- Completed feature previously in "Planned future features" → move it to "Main components"

### .specs/plans/ updates

When a feature is complete:

- Update Status in `.specs/plans/feature-[name].md` to `[x] Completed`
- Add a line "Completed on: [date]" and "Notes: [any deviations from plan]"

---

## Instructions that never change

- Do not write code without reading ADR first (if it exists)
- Do not add features that were not explicitly requested
- Do not use libraries not declared in ADR without approval
- If a feature brief contradicts ADR, report it before executing
- Your main job is execution — architectural decisions belong to the developer

<!-- OPENWIKI:START -->

## OpenWiki

This repository has a generated `openwiki/` evidence index. It is optional just-in-time context, not required startup reading.

- Treat source code and tests as authoritative. A brief's unknowns and review items are verification gaps, not automatic requirements.
- Prefer the narrowest quiet validation that proves the changed behavior. Preserve complete failure output.

The scheduled OpenWiki GitHub Actions workflow refreshes the repository wiki. Do not hand-edit generated OpenWiki pages unless explicitly asked; prefer updating source code/docs and letting OpenWiki regenerate.
